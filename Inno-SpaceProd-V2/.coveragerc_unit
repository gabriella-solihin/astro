    # the following is a list of modules that are excluded from
    # coverage TEMPORARILY for being less stable.
    # criteria for being excluded:
    # - recently introduced and not battle-tested modules
    # - expected to change substantially in near future

    # system integ still actively being developed during SIT/UAT period

    # this logic is not currently part of the pipeline but we don't want
    # to delete it as Inno team may wish to integrate it later into the
    # pipeline
